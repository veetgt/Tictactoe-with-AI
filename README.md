# ðŸ¤– Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI

An implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player faces an unbeatable AI based on the Minimax algorithm. This project was developed as part of Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python course.

## Features

- Graphical user interface (GUI) created with the Pygame library.
- Complete game logic with win, loss, and tie detection.
- An AI opponent that uses the Minimax algorithm to calculate the optimal move, ensuring it never loses.
- Modular design that separates the game logic (`tictactoe.py`) from the graphical interface (`runner.py`).

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pygame** for the graphical interface
- **Minimax Algorithm** for the AI logic
